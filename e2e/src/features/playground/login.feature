    Scenario: As a user I can populate login details leveraging environment variables
        Given I am on the "home" page
        And I click the "playground" button
        When I am directed to the "playground" page
        And I scroll to the "login form" element
        And I fill in the "email" input with "$.TEST_EMAIL"
        Then I fill in the "password" input with "$.TEST_PASSWORD"
        And the "email" should contain the value "admin@testingtalkshub.com.au"
        And the "password" should contain the value "DaPassword!"
